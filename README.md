# A Data-driven Look at the Pandemic's Effect on Industries and Economic Sectors

## Context

In late 2019, the world was confronted with a global health crisis that would reshape economies, societies, and industries. The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed unprecedented challenges and uncertainties, forcing businesses to adapt rapidly to the changing landscape. In this analysis, I conducted a data-driven research of how the pandemic impacted various industries worldwide. By examining key metrics and trends, I aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's far-reaching effects on sectors such as healthcare, retail, technology, oil & gas, and more.
